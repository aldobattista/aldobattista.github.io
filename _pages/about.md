Dr. **Aldo Battista** is a Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at the Center for Neural Science at **New York University**, where he investigates the computational principles underlying brain function. His research lies at the intersection of **neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics**, with a focus on biologically inspired neural architectures for learning, memory, vision, and decision-making.

He earned his **Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics** from the **École Normale Supérieure** in Paris, where he applied methods from statistical physics to develop novel models of neural computation. Prior to his doctoral work, he received both his **M.Sc.** and **B.Sc.** in Theoretical Physics with highest honors from **Sapienza University of Rome**.

Aldo's work integrates techniques from **machine learning**, **computational neuroscience**, and **dynamical systems theory** to build interpretable models of cognition and behavior. His long-term goal is to bridge biological understanding with artificial intelligence through the lens of large-scale, neurobiologically grounded models.
